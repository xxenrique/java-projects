/**
 * Given 2 Command Line Arguments: a String, and an integer
 * the output will repeat the string the specified number of times
 * 
 * This program is a throwback to Week 5 when we first looked at running a program
 * with command line arguments. The method main(String[] args) has a parameter:
 * an array of String objects. We use it here to collect a String and an integer from
 * the user, and then print the String the number of times given as the secound arg.
 * 
 * Also in this example are some try, catch, throw, and throws keywords. 
 * 
 * To run a program from the command line...
 * 1. navigate with a Terminal window (Mac, Linux) or Command window (Microsoft) to your bin directory
 * 2. type >> java lab10/ExceptionHandlingExample "test" 2 
 * ... where "test" and 2 are your command line arguments, and lab10 is the package (containing folder)
 * 
 * OR
 * You can use your IDE to configure command line inputs. Do a web search or see your IDE's Help for specifics.
 * In Eclipse, it's Run > Run Configurations: Arguments Tab
 * 
 *
